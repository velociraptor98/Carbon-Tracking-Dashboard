# Carbon Vis

This project is developed with the aim of providing an alternate dashboard to the existing code carbon dashboard. Built using react and tremor to provide a modern and responsive web dashboard to monitor the carbon and energy consumption of any big data pipeline. Currently the whole idea is to host the web app on any provider or on prem solution and providing the file where the outputs are written for every pipeline run. 

## Current Instructions

Simply host the website on any provider. The sample dashboard is deployed using netlify. Currently the file for carbon emissions is being read from the public section.
